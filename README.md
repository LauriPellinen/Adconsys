## Data analysis and machine learning schoolproject for finnish company AdConSys Oy

## Overview

- The main goal in this project was to implement Machine Learning model to predict the temperature of water ventilation system. 
- Adconsys Oy is finnish company which mostly develops automation systems and ventilation systems 
- We used neural networks (Pytorch) to predict the right temperature. Both classification and regression models were used in the project

- The aim of the project was to find out which factors are essential for predicting the right temperature, and to create an in-depth machine learning model (neural network) based on the data obtained.

- Steps that we had during this project
	- Data analysis (preprocessing, cleaning and minig)
	- Selecting and testing the best possible parameters and other factors using the neural network
	- Testing ML methods
- Project was made in a group of 4 so not all of the code is self made.

## Note

- Any used data had to be removed due to privacy reasons.
